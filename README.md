### Welcome to Dynamic Wine, the app that allows restaurants to select the perfect bottles for their unique winelist. You can filter your establishment's wine list by color or country. Our interactive map shows you exactly where it came from, and handsome modals allow you to get to know your wines better before inviting them to your dinner party.

## Memories made on this journey...
### Coding google maps, filters, CRUD operations, UI/UX, deploying to Heroku, mastering >100 Github commits, and  Passport.js authentication were each personal mountains. The group had to restart two separate times. On the bright side, each failure WAS accompanied by learning.

## Installation, Setup, and How to contribute.
### From the command line, type "git clone https://github.com/carolinetwyman/dynamicwine.git". Then type "npm install," and "npm start."
### To contribute, make a pull request to a new branch with a descriptive request, and we will review!

### To add wines, you have 3 options: 1) use our dummy list by typing "npm run seed." 2) Alternatively, you can manually enter a wine list into scripts/seedDB.js followed by "npm run seed." 3) Or enter them through the website, using the winefinder and clicking submit for each wine.
